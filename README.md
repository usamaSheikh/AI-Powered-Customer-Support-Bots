# AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Bots
Bots that can handle common queries, resolve issues, and escalate complex cases to human agents. These are widely used in sectors like ecommerce, SaaS, healthcare, and telecom.


1. Run app.py in F:\ChatBot\An-AI-Chatbot-in-Python-and-Flask-main

**Create Virtual Environment:**

1. Create a New Virtual Environment in a Short Path:

Move to a shorter directory, such as directly in C:\. Run these commands in your command prompt:

    cd C:\
    python -m venv chatbot_env
    chatbot_env\Scripts\activate
    
   ** Install TensorFlow and Other Packages:**

2. Once inside the new environment, try installing TensorFlow and other dependencies:

    pip install tensorflow
    pip install nltk keras flask

This approach should avoid the path length limitation by using a directory with a shorter path. Let me know if this helps!
